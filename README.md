`microsoft/git` and the Scalar CLI
==================================

[![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://open.vscode.dev/badges/open-in-vscode.svg)](https://open.vscode.dev/microsoft/git)
[![Build status](https://github.com/microsoft/git/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/git/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is `microsoft/git`, a special Git distribution to support monorepo scenarios. If you are _not_
working in a monorepo, you are likely searching for
[Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) instead of this codebase.

In addition to the Git command-line interface (CLI), `microsoft/git` includes the Scalar CLI to
further enable working with extremely large repositories. Scalar is a tool to apply the latest
recommendations and use the most advanced Git features. You can read
[the Scalar CLI documentation](Documentation/scalar.txt) or read our
[Scalar user guide](contrib/scalar/docs/index.md) including
[the philosophy of Scalar](contrib/scalar/docs/philosophy.md).

If you encounter problems with `microsoft/git`, please report them as
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/microsoft/git/issues).

Why is this fork needed?
=========================================================

Git is awesome - it's a fast, scalable, distributed version control system with an unusually rich
command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. What more could
you ask for?

Well, because Git is a distributed version control system, each Git repository has a copy of all
files in the entire history. As large repositories, aka _monorepos_ grow, Git can struggle to
manage all that data. As Git commands like `status` and `fetch` get slower, developers stop waiting
and start switching context. And context switches harm developer productivity.

`microsoft/git` is focused on addressing these performance woes and making the monorepo developer
experience first-class. The Scalar CLI packages all of these recommendations into a simple set of
commands.

One major feature that Scalar recommends is [partial clone](https://github.blog/2020-12-21-get-up-to-speed-with-partial-clone-and-shallow-clone/),
which reduces the amount of data transferred in order to work with a Git repository. While several
services such as GitHub support partial clone, Azure Repos instead has an older version of this
functionality called
[the GVFS protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/git/gvfs-architecture#gvfs-protocol).
The integration with the GVFS protocol present in `microsoft/git` is not appropriate to include in
the core Git client because partial clone is the official version of that functionality.

Downloading and Installing
=========================================================

If you're working in a monorepo and want to take advantage of the performance boosts in
`microsoft/git`, then you can download the latest version installer for your OS from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/git/releases). Alternatively, you can opt to install
via the command line, using the below instructions for supported OSes:

## Windows

__Note:__ Winget is still in public preview, meaning you currently
[need to take special installation steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget):
Either manually install the `.appxbundle` available at the
[preview version of App Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/p/app-installer/9nblggh4nns1?ocid=9nblggh4nns1_ORSEARCH_Bing&rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab),
or participate in the
[Windows Insider flight ring](https://insider.windows.com/https://insider.windows.com/)
since `winget` is available by default on preview versions of Windows.

To install with Winget, run

```shell
winget install --id microsoft.git
```

Double-check that you have the right version by running these commands,
which should have the same output:

```shell
git version
scalar version
```

To upgrade `microsoft/git`, use the following Git command, which will download and install the latest
release.

```shell
git update-microsoft-git
```

You may also be alerted with a notification to upgrade, which presents a single-click process for
running `git update-microsoft-git`.

## macOS

To install `microsoft/git` on macOS, first [be sure that Homebrew is installed](https://brew.sh/) then
install the `microsoft-git` cask with these steps:

```shell
brew tap microsoft/git
brew install --cask microsoft-git
```

Double-check that you have the right version by running these commands,
which should have the same output:

```shell
git version
scalar version
```

To upgrade microsoft/git, you can run the necessary `brew` commands:

```shell
brew update
brew upgrade --cask microsoft-git
```

Or you can run the `git update-microsoft-git` command, which will run those brew commands for you.

## Linux
### Ubuntu/Debian distributions

On newer distributions*, you may use the most recent
[Debian package](https://github.com/microsoft/git/releases). For
example, you can download a specific version as follows:

```shell
wget -O microsoft-git.deb https://github.com/microsoft/git/releases/download/v2.33.0.vfs.0.0/microsoft-git_2.33.0.vfs.0.0.deb
sudo dpkg -i microsoft-git.deb
```

Double-check that you have the right version by running these commands,
which should have the same output:

```shell
git version
scalar version
```

To upgrade, you will need to repeat these steps to reinstall.

*Older distributions are missing some required dependencies. Even
though the package may appear to install successfully, `microsoft/
git` will not function as expected. If you are running Ubuntu 18.04 or
older, please follow the install from source instructions below
instead of installing the debian package.

### Other distributions

You will need to compile and install `microsoft/git` from source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/git microsoft-git
cd microsoft-git
make -j12 prefix=/usr/local
sudo make -j12 prefix=/usr/local install
```

For more assistance building Git from source, see
[the INSTALL file in the core Git project](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/INSTALL).
